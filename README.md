Migrated to codeberg. Don't use this repo. Go here instead: https://codeberg.org/Adamcake/Bolt

You can download releases from here if you must, but there may be a newer version available on codeberg since this repo is no longer updated. New issues and PRs also need to go there.

This repo will eventually be deleted. If you have a fork of this repo on github.com, I kindly ask that you delete it as well. You are of course welcome to fork a more up-to-date version on codeberg.
